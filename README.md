# JSMP
*J stands for Just*
# Main principles
1. Prevent chaos not by enforcing server-wide strict rules, but by giving everyone, even beginner players, a chance for self-defense
2. [Deus otiosus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_otiosus)
3. Any player can only gain an advantage through in-game means, by self-reliance or cooperation with other players. Gaining an advantage through external methods outside the scope of regular gameplay, be it from another human or non-human actor, is not allowed.
