## Reasoning
- Elytra is one of the fastest methods of transportation that does not require any specific structures, biomes, weather conditions or attitudes to work
- Elytras are only available to players that have enough resources to travel to end cities
- See main principle 1
## Other methods being too slow
- Elytra is still the predominant (and the fastest) method of transportation if you have a high enough structure
- Hyperloops and "Dolphin's Grace status effect with Depth Strider III and Soul Speed III on a layer of soul soil underwater" are faster
